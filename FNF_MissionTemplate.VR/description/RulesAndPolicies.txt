"Friday Night Fight<br/>
Official Rules and Policies of Friday Night Fight<br/>
<br/><br/>
1) Community Leadership<br/>
  1. Community Leaders are responsible for maintaining the integrity and maturity of their membership and assuring their members are informed about and follow the rules/policies of Friday Night Fight. Staff should NOT have to babysit or reprimand a member of any community.<br/>
<br/><br/>
2) Mission Slotting/Role Selection Screen<br/>
  1. Players should remain quiet in the Operations Room to allow FNF Staff to slot communities during role selection. Community Leaders are allowed to speak to organize their teams, but should do so with brevity, and should not speak over FNF Staff.<br/>
  2. Only Community Leaders and FNF Staff are allowed to text posts in the Operations channel in TeamSpeak. If players would like to chat during role selection, they may use the in-game lobby chat.<br/>
  3. If a player has to be told they have a “Hot Mic” (a microphone that is turned on and picking up outside distractions) twice, that player will be forced to use push-to-talk.<br/>
  4. Communities with the most members will be slotted up first. They will be given the opportunity to platoon lead. However, they may defer, allowing the next slotted community the option to platoon lead. If all other groups defer, the leading group will then have to platoon lead.<br/>
  5. Community members must play the role that they’ve selected.<br/>
    1. For example, if a player selects a role within a squad/fireteam, they belong on that team even if they are or are not slotted with their community.  This should continue throughout the mission unless otherwise permitted by the Platoon Leader.<br/>
  6. Community Leaders must ensure Platoon, Squad, and Team Leaders know how to use Task Force Radio.<br/>
  7. Your radio frequencies will be assigned to you at the mission start, viewable via the ORBAT (accessible through the map). Do NOT deviate from the assigned frequencies unless necessitated by gameplay (radios compromised).<br/>
  8. During each event, a player may only fill a specialty role once. Once they have done so, they may only do so again within that segment if the slot remains open after all present players have been successfully slotted.<br/>
    1. For example, John may play Marksman during Round 1 EU. He may not play Marksman again during Round 2 or Round 3 EU, unless a Marksman slot remains open after ALL players have been slotted. This ineligibility would not carry over to the NA segment.<br/>
    2. Applicable specialty roles include:<br/>
      1. Company CO<br/>
      2. Platoon Leader<br/>
      3. Recon Team Leader<br/>
      4. Recon Team Marksman<br/>
      5. Any/All Slots in Hotel<br/>
      6. Any/All Slots in Golf<br/>
<br/><br/>
3) Safe Start<br/>
  1. Players are NOT allowed to leave the Safe Start area(s) before the mission starts unless otherwise instructed by the Mission Maker.<br/>
  2. Players are NOT allowed to discharge weapons during Safe Start.<br/>
  3. During Safe Start, unless necessary, players are to keep their voice volume to normal or whisper levels as to not disturb others.<br/>
  4. Players are NOT allowed to play music, soundboards, or use any other disruptions that delay, distract, or otherwise impede players from briefing their teams (don’t be annoying).<br/>
<br/><br/>
4) In-Game<br/>
  1. Squad Leaders and Fireteam Leaders are to stay in communication (Radio Comms) and follow the orders of the Platoon Leader to the best of their ability. You may give suggestions to your leadership, but your leadership has the final say. Do not argue with your leadership.<br/>
  2. Do NOT use in-game chat during a mission, such as a side chat, global chat, or group chat. If you need to reach a staff member, poke or message them in TeamSpeak.<br/>
  3. Mission-specific rules: FNF Mission Makers are able to impose standalone rules within their missions. These rules will be communicated at the start of the mission and recorded in-game within the briefing. Players are required to follow any mission-specific rules if they are present within the mission.<br/>
  4. Rambo: Players are expected to stay with the fireteam/squad that they originally slotted up with throughout the entire mission. Players are NOT allowed to run away from their team and/or cease communication in order to play the mission as a solo player.<br/>
  5. Squad asset control: Platoon leadership cannot directly control game assets given to specific squads without the Squad Leader’s approval.<br/>
<br/><br/>
5) Regulated Actions and Respective Stipulations<br/>
Failure to comply with any of the following will result in a kick from the server for the remainder of the event:<br/>
  1. Use of Enemy Uniforms and Equipment: Players are slotted to a specific team and are NOT allowed to use any uniforms or helmets from the opposing side. Players are allowed to use enemy radios, chest rigs, backpacks, and weapons.<br/>
  2. Players are NOT allowed to steal any items or vehicles without the controlling player’s or Platoon Leader's consent. This includes looking into another player's backpack without their consent, taking items from another player's backpack, or stealing vehicles designated for other squads by the Platoon Leader. The Platoon Leader has the final say regarding the use of in-mission assets.<br/>
  3. No VBIEDs (Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices): Players are NOT allowed to attach explosives to a vehicle for use as an offensive “suicide” weapon. Attaching explosives to an enemy vehicle is allowed as long as the player does not use the vehicle as an SVBIED (Suicide Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device). Attaching explosives to a stationary vehicle to use as a trap is also allowed.<br/>
  4. Non-consenting player hostages and VIPs are NOT allowed to be handcuffed unless allowed by the Mission Maker for gameplay purposes. Hostages and VIPs are NOT to be used as human shields. Players are allowed to handcuff enemy players and consenting friendly players.<br/>
  5. Drivers are forbidden from intentionally using their vehicle as a weapon (except when attempting to avoid imminent danger and all other options have been exhausted). FNF Staff has absolute discretion on what constitutes an imminent danger and will review any suspicious or questionable instance.<br/>
  6. Players are forbidden from using fortifications to block building entry points, hallways and roads. That is, do not place trenches and fortifications that prevent movement through roads, doorways, stairwells, ladders, etc. Building interiors should be fully traversable.<br/>
  7. Players are forbidden from climbing onto objects that could not normally support their weight, i.e., trees, power lines, etc.<br/>
  8. If a player demonstrates gross incompetence or willful mismanagement of game assets (vehicles, static weapons, etc.), they may be asked to cease further use of those game assets. Furthermore, if FNF Staff believes that the assets are being abused, immediate action can be taken to remove the player from further use of the asset.<br/>
<br/><br/>
6) Bannable Offenses<br/>
Failure to comply with any of the following will result in a BAN for players and disciplinary action against the player’s associated community:<br/>
  1. Racist or Racial Slurs: Any player making a racist remark or a racial slur will be banned from Friday Night Fight and a community strike will be applied to their associated group.<br/>
  2. Hacking: Any player found to be hacking or exploiting in any form will be banned and a community strike will be applied to their associated group.<br/>
  3. Stream-Sniping: Players are allowed to stream the event through any medium they wish. Players are NOT allowed to stream-snipe. If a player is found to be stream-sniping, they will be banned from Friday Night Fight.<br/>
  4. Ghosting and Metagaming: Players are NOT allowed to use Steam chat or any other form of communication to communicate game information with alive players.<br/>
  5. Gamma Abuse: Players are NOT allowed to turn up their gamma to improve visibility during night missions. (The FNF mission template places a limit on the gamma value within the ingame video settings)<br/>
  6. Team Killing: There will be ZERO TOLERANCE for intentionally killing friendly players. Do not teamkill.<br/>
7) Discord Rules and Guidelines<br/>
  1. Be Respectful: You must respect all users, regardless of your opinions, beliefs, past interactions, etc. Treat others the way you want to be treated.<br/>
  2. No Inappropriate Language: The use of profanity should be kept to a minimum. Derogatory language towards any user is prohibited.<br/>
  3. No Spamming: Don't send a slew of small messages right after each other. Do NOT disrupt chat with a large number of photos, memes, unrelated comments, etc.<br/>
  4. No Pornographic/Adult/NSFW Material: This is a community server and not meant to share this kind of material.<br/>
  5. No Unsolicited Advertisements: We do NOT tolerate any kind of advertisement. You can post your content in the media channel if it is relevant and provides value (videos, art, etc).<br/>
  6. No Offensive Usernames or Profile Pictures: You will be asked to change your name or picture if FNF Staff deems them inappropriate.<br/>
  7. Direct and Indirect Threats: Threats to other users including DDoSing, death threats, doxxing, verbal abuse, and/or other maliciousness are prohibited.<br/>
  8. Server Raiding: Raiding or mentions of raiding are NOT allowed.<br/>

<br/><br/>
8) Miscellaneous<br/>
  1. The Admins and Mods will mute/kick/ban based on discretion. If you feel mistreated, dm an Admin to resolve the issue.<br/>
  2. All discord channels contain pinned messages explaining their purpose and how everything works. If you don't understand something, feel free to ask a channel member.<br/>
