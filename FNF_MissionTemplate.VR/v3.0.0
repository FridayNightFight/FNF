disable the auto marking, it looks dumb atm

add the player markers again

removing controls still doesnt work but loadout lockout works now // genuinely no idea how to fix this

look into TP in random pos within a marker?  //  may be possible with BIS_fnc_randomPOS

scroll wheel to reopen loadout selector  //  simple add and remove action to set loadout chosen to false
