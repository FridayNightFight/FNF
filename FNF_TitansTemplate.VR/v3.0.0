removing controls still doesnt work but loadout lockout works now // genuinely no idea how to fix this

if players are fast enough, two players can take the same loadout at once // implement server side checking

JIP fails to move players to correct sides at round start

bodies are not being deleted in safe start allowing for item duplication

ground items must be cleaned up between rounds

remove inventory action when loadout GUI is selected
