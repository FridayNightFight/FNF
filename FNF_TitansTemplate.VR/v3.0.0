removing controls still doesnt work but loadout lockout works now // genuinely no idea how to fix this

if players are fast enough, two players can take the same loadout at once // implement server side checking // Maybe Fixed?

JIP fails to move players to correct sides at round start // Fixed Maybe?

bodies are not being deleted in safe start allowing for item duplication // Fixed

ground items must be cleaned up between rounds // Fixed

remove inventory action when loadout GUI is selected // Fixed
